* Minestuck Datapack Generator
** Graphical Interface
The ~gui~ program will attempt to parse the datapack in ~datapack/~, if it exists, and will export a valid datapack to ~datapack/~ which you can rename or place the contents of into a zip file for a datapack Minecraft can load

** Command Line
~grist_json~ accepts comma separated values (csv) from a file or through standard input in the format of
#+BEGIN_SRC csv
  modid:itemname,build=20,ruby=4
#+END_SRC
It will generate a data directory with all the grist cost json files to put in a datapack
